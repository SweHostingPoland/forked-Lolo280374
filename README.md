<h6>MY USERNAME IS NOT LOGDOTZIP!!!</h6>

## Who am I?
### Hi, I won't do a huge biography because honestly I'm failing grammar class on my own, but I love coding, making stuff, watching anime, and I don't know.. learning stuff on my own? (I hate being taught by a teacher I just prefer watching YouTube courses and doing the stuff on my own.)
### So far I'm not doing anything crazy, I don't work for nasa. I just do shit projects to spend time and to try learning a couple languages, that could be valuable in the near future or something, and to participate in cool events from Hack Club, like Siege!!

---

## My projects?
### I do some projects that are absolutely out of wack and make no sense, but I actually enjoyed making some, like clickSiege - Google Sheets is not a good database!! and openYourRadio, because seeing it actually work is so fun! Coding is so fun when stuff actually works. Genius right?
### Maybe more projects coming soon, check repos I guess?
### And some projects are just dead abandonned like the crunchyroll-webOS thing, that TV is just way too slow to handle stuff.
